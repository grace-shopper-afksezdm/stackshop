        <h1>Welcome to Fleuria Flower Shop!</h1>
        <p>
          We are a women-founded, women-supporting small business. Our mission
          is to source organically-grown, environmentally-sustainable floral
          crops from female-identifying and non-binary growers. We work
          primarily to buy within the US in order to minimize our carbon
          footprint. However, we are working on outreach efforts across borders
          to support developing nations in their efforts to be ecologically
          responsible and economically sound. 10% of our profits are donated to
          charities supporting causes aligned with Fleuria's core values. <br />
          <br />We hope you enjoy shopping with us!
